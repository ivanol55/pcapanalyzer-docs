# Database picker

When you click on the menu entry for `Current database`, you will be redirected to the database management page. In this site, you will get two different options: you can either change what database you want to use for analysis, or you can delete databases when you're done with them.

On the first option, you need to pick the database you want to see the data of from the drop-down menu, then click **confirm**. The app will then redirect you to the system homepage with your new database as the active data source.

If you're done with a database and you want to delete it from the system, use the lower form. Select the database you wanna drop, then click **drop**. The database will be deleted, and you will be redirected to the homepage with `packetstream` as the new data source database.
