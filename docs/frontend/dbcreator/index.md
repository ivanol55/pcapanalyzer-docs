# dbCreator analysis database generator

Apart from the `packetstream` data capture system, you can also upload your own `.pcap` files for the PCAPAnalyzer system to generate analysis databases with. On this form, you will input a database name, then upload all of your `.pcap` files to read into the system. Once this is done, click on `Create new database` for the system to start the process.

This page will stay loading until the process is done. Do not close the page until you are redirected to the system's homepage. Keep in mind that depending on the size of your `.pcap` files and system performance, this process could take some time to complete.

You can upload, at most, 100 megabyte individual files, or a total of 200 megabytes of data.

Once the database creation process is complete, you can proceed to the database picker and start doing data analysis on your new database.
